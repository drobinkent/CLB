#=================== Basically We do not need to touch these fields. Because here we are just setting the link speed to maximum capacity of mininet.

# Assuming 4 port switch, 2 * 10 Mbps for host to leaf. 2*10 for leaf to spine. Each po have 2 spine switch, each spine connects to 2 super spine. therefor 4 connection. 4*5 = 20
